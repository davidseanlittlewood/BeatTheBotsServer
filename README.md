# BotWars

BotWars is a game designed for a hackathon or team building event. Teams compete to program their ultimate fighting machines, Each team should be made up of multi-disciplied people who do not work together day to day and should be equiped with a computer, a copy of the instruction books, the VanillaBot solution, and large amounts of pizza.

## How to run BotWars

Running a BotWars event is easy. You need half a day, a quiet space, and a group of people.

We recommend teams of four or five people, each one seeded with a developer. One of the huge motivations for running a BotWars event is to meet and work alongside new people so we recommend randomising the other team members. Names in a hat is a tried and tested method.

Each of your teams should have a laptop, a copy of the rules, and the BotExample solution (assuming you're working in .NET). We also recommend a selection of pens and squared paper. As the organisor you will need a copy of the BattleOfTheBots application running on your computer.

Rounds can be randomised but we recommend:

* 45 minutes to create the first version of your bots
* Round 1, all competitors and the easy house bots
* 45 minutes tinker time
* Round 2, all competitors and the harder house bots
* 45 minutes tinker time
* Round 3, all competitors
* Round 4, the top three scoring competitors to decide an overall winner

The scores for rounds 1, 2, and 3 are cumulative so it's better to have a very simple bot in each round than no bot at all.

## Technical Suggestions

* Make sure your teams are running the bot solution as an administrator, it helps with the permissions for the HttpListener class
* Make sure each team can connect in the initial 45 minutes tinker time, you don't want technical problems spoiling your first round
